# This is a demo for visualize the attention weight from deeparc

## Introduction
1.models.py: about model<br>
2.load_data.py: data_preprocessing and padding<br>
3.pad.py: visualize the attention weight for sequence by drawing a heat map

## Before running
Please loading the pretraining model in the correct path in pad.py before u run.At the end of the run, a heatmap representing the attention weight by deeparc will be generated.
